A static site designed and built from the ground up with the main objective of increasing the clients reach online. This is a content driven site that allows the client to show the services they offer as well as pricing and contact information.

This is crafted using HTML, CSS and Javascript with simplicity and speed being key points identified by the client. The desire was for a 'strong' looking website that reflected the clients own personality and this therefore informed the design decision to go with the darker colour scheme and bold typography. Users are also able to fill out a form to receive a consultation from the trainer.
