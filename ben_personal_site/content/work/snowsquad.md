This was the final project built with my team during the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) bootcamp. Our mission was to design and build a platform were people could find a group of like minded skiers (& snowboarders!) to ride with. It is a common problem faced by many that it can be difficult to organise trips like this with friends.

SnowSquad was created using Ruby on Rails and allows users to search for and see information on specific resorts such as snow conditions and available ski lifts. Once a user is in a resort they can 'check in' which allows them to see groups that are active in the area. They can then join a particular group and join a conversation or simply see details of the next meet up location. If no group matches your needs then feel free to create your own.
