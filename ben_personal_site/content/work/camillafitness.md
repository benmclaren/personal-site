A static Hugo site designed and built from scratch. The main objective is to increase online presence and have a centralised location where potential clients can complete questionires before signing up for sessions. This is a content driven site that allows the client to show the services they offer as well as pricing and contact information.

This is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the static site generator Hugo. It also features a content management system (CMS) that the client can log on to and make changes to the site as and when they need to.

It features a clean and simple design with a custom theme being designed and built to meet the clients needs and requirements.
