An e-commerce platform that will be used to sell the football cards that I have designed and made for my team, the Outgoing Kobras.

The app is built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. I like to use side projects to explore as many technolgoes as possible and in this case I have used Tailwind, LottieFiles, FramerMotion and DasiyUI on the frontend. The platform includes stripe payments integrated with my Railway database.

I am continualy adding to this app with new features and soemtimes complete style changes.
