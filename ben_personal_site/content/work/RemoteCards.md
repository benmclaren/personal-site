I built this alongside my brother [Harry](https://harrycresswell.com/). The coronavirus outbreak meant that a lot of people in service industries were left stuck at home and having to turn to offering their services online over zoom or other live streaming platforms. We came up with this create a card generator model to help people promote their services. The idea is that you create a custom card, then share it with your friends on social media. It’s a bit of fun whilst we’re all stuck at home.

This project is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), our favourite static site generator and base for many of my front-end websites. This is combined with HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a simple but clean design that prioritises its form and ease of use for the user.

Do feel free to check it out and create your own cards.
