I built this alongside my brother [Harry](https://harrycresswell.com/). The coronavirus outbreak meant that a lot of people in service industries were left stuck at home and having to turn to offering their services online over zoom or other live streaming platforms.

The idea is that you create a custom card, then share it with your friends on social media. It’s a bit of fun whilst we’re all stuck at home.
