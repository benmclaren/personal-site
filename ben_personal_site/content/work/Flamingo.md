Flamingo is a result of my team and I's efforts during the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) bootcamp. It is the first rails app that I created as part of a team. It is a simple AirBnB style web application that allows the ability to view properties in your chosen area to rent and list your own property on the site too.

It was designed and developed over the course of five days and is built using Ruby on Rails. It features an integration with the mapbox api to allow users to see property locations as well as a review system.
