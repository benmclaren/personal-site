## Work with me, or just say Hi

### What do I do?

Front-end + Design

I design and build websites from the ground up. My focus lies within front-end development and content driven static sites. I also love animating things and bringing content to life to create a beautiful and seamless user experience.

My tools of choice for this lie in the realm of “Jamstack” utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will often pair this with a static site generator such as Hugo as I have done for this site. This allows for very fast and accessible websites

Back-end

It is not out of scope for me to do back-end development if your project requires. I would turn to Ruby on Rails. A robust framework for creating fully responsive web applications capable of handling user driven content. I also have a team of developers I can call upon for larger scale applications that may require a small team.

If this sounds interesting to you or you would like to know more feel free to get in touch below. :)
