**Notes on the Le Wagon Hash & Symbols Array to Hash exercise**

We might want to convert an array into a hash.

Here are the constraints that it has:

- If no block is given, then the hash keys should just be integer indexes of elements in the array, converted as Strings.

- If a block is given, call it passing the array index and use whatâ€™s returned as the hash key.

1. First lets define an array which takes one parameter which we will call words.

```ruby
def group_anagrams(words)
  groups = {}
  words.each do |word|
    crash_word = word.downcase.chars.sort.join
    if groups[crash_word]
      groups[crash_word] << word
    else
      groups[crash_word] = [word]
    end
  end
  groups.values
end
```
2. Next, we create our hash, `groups` which has no content inside.

3. We now iterate over the argument, words using `.each`. Next, set a variable of `crash_word` which is equal to downcasing the word, splitting it into seperate characters, sorting them alphabetically and then joining them together.

4. Our if statement says that if groups contains the `crash_word` then add `word` into the hash using the `<<` opperator. Else, reassign `crash_word` to the array `word`.

5. groups.values will return a new array which is populated by groups of values from the hash.
