      <description>Work with me, or just say Hi What do I do? Front-end + Design
I design and build websites from the ground up. My focus lies within front-end development and content driven static sites. I also love animating things and bringing content to life to create a beautiful and seamless user experience.
My tools of choice for this lie in the realm of “Jamstack” utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will often pair this with a static site generator such as Hugo as I have done for this site.</description>
