      <description>An e-commerce platform that will be used to sell the football cards that I have designed and made for my team, the Outgoing Kobras.&#xA;The app is built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. I like to use side projects to explore as many technolgoes as possible and in this case I have used Tailwind, LottieFiles, FramerMotion and DasiyUI on the frontend. The platform includes stripe payments integrated with my Railway database.</description>

      <description>A static Hugo site designed and built from scratch. The main objective is to increase online presence and have a centralised location where potential clients can complete questionires before signing up for sessions. This is a content driven site that allows the client to show the services they offer as well as pricing and contact information.&#xA;This is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the static site generator Hugo. It also features a content management system (CMS) that the client can log on to and make changes to the site as and when they need to.</description>

      <description>I built this alongside my brother Harry. The coronavirus outbreak meant that a lot of people in service industries were left stuck at home and having to turn to offering their services online over zoom or other live streaming platforms. We came up with this create a card generator model to help people promote their services. The idea is that you create a custom card, then share it with your friends on social media.</description>

      <description>A static site designed and built from the ground up with the main objective of increasing the clients reach online. This is a content driven site that allows the client to show the services they offer as well as pricing and contact information.&#xA;This is crafted using HTML, CSS and Javascript with simplicity and speed being key points identified by the client. The desire was for a &amp;lsquo;strong&amp;rsquo; looking website that reflected the clients own personality and this therefore informed the design decision to go with the darker colour scheme and bold typography.</description>
