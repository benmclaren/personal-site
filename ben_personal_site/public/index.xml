      <description>An e-commerce platform that will be used to sell the football cards that I have designed and made for my team, the Outgoing Kobras.&#xA;The app is built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. I like to use side projects to explore as many technolgoes as possible and in this case I have used Tailwind, LottieFiles, FramerMotion and DasiyUI on the frontend. The platform includes stripe payments integrated with my Railway database.</description>

      <description>A static Hugo site designed and built from scratch. The main objective is to increase online presence and have a centralised location where potential clients can complete questionires before signing up for sessions. This is a content driven site that allows the client to show the services they offer as well as pricing and contact information.&#xA;This is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the static site generator Hugo. It also features a content management system (CMS) that the client can log on to and make changes to the site as and when they need to.</description>

      <description>I built this alongside my brother Harry. The coronavirus outbreak meant that a lot of people in service industries were left stuck at home and having to turn to offering their services online over zoom or other live streaming platforms. We came up with this create a card generator model to help people promote their services. The idea is that you create a custom card, then share it with your friends on social media.</description>

      <description>A static site designed and built from the ground up with the main objective of increasing the clients reach online. This is a content driven site that allows the client to show the services they offer as well as pricing and contact information.&#xA;This is crafted using HTML, CSS and Javascript with simplicity and speed being key points identified by the client. The desire was for a &amp;lsquo;strong&amp;rsquo; looking website that reflected the clients own personality and this therefore informed the design decision to go with the darker colour scheme and bold typography.</description>

      <description>We are going to make a scrollbar that will scroll horizontally as the user scrolls vertically down the page. This is a nice feature to have especially on longer pages as you can quickly display to the user how far through an article they are.&#xA;We need to use JQuery for this so make sure that you have imported the JQuery library. See this site as a demonstration of what we are going to build.</description>

      <description>SEO is an important but often overlooked aspect of web development. It is essential in ensuring the maximum exposure for your website and good SEO can really improve traffic to your sites.&#xA;Dynamic page titles Imagine that we have a review website. We might want to have the title of our webpage change depending on which page of our website the user is on.&#xA;Rails has a helper method called content_for that allows us to do just that.</description>

      <description>An overlay seems like it would be something difficult to achieve however, it is actually relatively simple and it can be done with just CSS.&#xA;For this example, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that you wish to overlay text on an image when you hover over it. To do this let&amp;rsquo;s first take a look at some HTML.&#xA;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;photo&amp;#34; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;overlay&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; some text &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;my-image.jpg&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt; Above is some simple HTML code for an image contained in a section.</description>

      <description>Flexbox is a very powerful tool and it is one that can be used to create many different layouts.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you wish to lay out a selection of images on a page in a grid style. In the past this would have been difficult to achieve inlvolving developers needing to &amp;lsquo;hack&amp;rsquo; their way around it using floats. However, with only a few lines of code flexbox is able to create a grid.</description>

      <title>An Inline navigation bar</title>

      <description>One of the key components on my site is the navigation bar. Initially, I had attempted to create this using floats however, I quickly realised that this was not an effective way of constructing this element. It was at this point that I researched Flexbox and how it can be used to make a responsive component.&#xA;Setting out the HTML &amp;lt;header class=&amp;#34;header&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul class=&amp;#34;nav&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li class=&amp;#34;nav-link&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;work.html&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Work&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li class=&amp;#34;nav-link&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;articles.</description>

      <title>Making responsive text</title>

      <description>Websites need to look good across a multitude of screens and therfore it is essential that a site is responsive so that a user&amp;rsquo;s experience is not affected by their choice of screen size. I encountered a problem whilst building this site that was causing some of my headers to be cut off of the page when the browser size was reduced. I had previously tried using margins and padding to try and fix this issue however, some research led me to media queries.</description>

      <description>The best decison I could have made&#xA;One of the most common questions children are asked is &amp;lsquo;What do you want to be when you are older?&amp;rsquo;. In my opinion this is quite a difficult question to answer. Not many people have a firm idea of what they really want to do. There are of course those who know exactly which career direction they wish to pursue, medicine for example. However, for most of us, finding that one thing that is going to spark your interest and kickstart your career is quite hard to discover.</description>
